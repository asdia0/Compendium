Solutions can be found in Section~\ref{S::2023-O-2}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \hyperrefitem[A::2023-O-2-1] In a scalene triangle $ABC$ with centroid $G$ and circumcircle $\o$ centred at $O$, the extension of $AG$ meets $\o$ at $M$; lines $AB$ and $CM$ intersect at $P$; and lines $AC$ and $BM$ intersect at $Q$. Suppose the circumcentre $S$ of the triangle $APQ$ lies on $\o$ and $A$, $O$, $S$ are collinear. Prove that $\angle AGO = 90\deg$.
    \hyperrefitem[A::2023-O-2-2] A grid of cells is tiled with dominoes such that every cell is covered by exactly one domino. A subset $S$ of dominoes is chosen. Is it true that at least one of the following two statements is false?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There are 2022 more horizontal dominoes than vertical dominoes in $S$.
        \item The cells covered by the dominoes in $S$ can be tiled completely and exactly by L-shaped tetrominoes.
    \end{enumerate}
    \hyperrefitem[A::2023-O-2-3] Let $n \geq 2$ be a positive integer. For a positive integer $a$, let $Q_a(x) = x^n + ax$. Let $p$ be a prime and let $S_a = \bc{b \mid 0 \leq b \leq p - 1, \exists c \in \ZZ, Q_a(c) \equiv b \pmod{p}}$. Show that $\frac{1}{p-1} \sum_{a=1}^{p-1} \abs{S_a}$ is an integer.
    \hyperrefitem[A::2023-O-2-4] Find all functions $f : \ZZ \to \ZZ$, such that \[f(x+y)((f(x) - f(y))^2 + f(xy)) = f(x^3) + f(y^3)\] for all integers $x$, $y$.
    \hyperrefitem[A::2023-O-2-5] Determine all real numbers $x$ between 0 and 180 such that it is possible to partition an equilateral triangle into finitely many triangles, each of which has an angle of $x\deg$.
\end{enumerate}
